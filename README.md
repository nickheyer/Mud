# Mud
Mud aspires to be a community sourced mod management framework and application. Inherently compatible with any game or platform, Mud does it all.


## Development

### Community Mudfiles
Mudfiles are the heart of the Mud Mod Manager. They are open-source instructions that tell Mud how to install a mod, download/install system dependencies, pull mod files from the internet, etc.

You can find all currently available `.mudfiles` here: [Mud.Community](https://github.com/nickheyer/Mud.Community)
