# Mud
Mud aspires to be a community sourced mod management language, runtime, and desktop application. Inherently compatible with any game or platform, Mud does it all.

## Installation
Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/nickheyer/Mud/releases) page and download the installer that matches your operating system.

> Only the pre-alpha dev build is available, which is currently just a proof of concept interface for the underlying scripting language / interpreter (WIP).

## Development

## Community Mudfiles
Mudfiles are the heart of the Mud Mod Manager. They are open-source instructions that tell Mud how to install a mod, download/install system dependencies, pull mod files from the internet, etc.

You can find all currently available `.mudfiles` here: [Mud.Community](https://github.com/nickheyer/Mud.Community)

> While mudfiles can be imported via a `repl` session using pre-processor commands like `!include_files ./helloworld.mud`, the source control management has not yet been implemented in Mud (though it's in it's early dev stages and close to done!).
